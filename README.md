Project Title 

Play Dates for Pets

What and Why?

This is designed for pet parents who are looking to socialize their little ones. Socialization and desensitization is especially important in the early development stages of our pets. This makes it easier to connect with other pet parents. There can be additional social media features like the option to post pictures of your pet! Additionally, this socialization and being able to see cute pictures can be therapeutic <3


For Whom?

For pet parents and people looking for friends! Animals, like humans, are social creatures. 

How? 

This will work similar to dating apps where users can customize and create their own profile. Each profile should include the species/breed of their pet, friendliness level, and what kind of friends they are looking for! Of course users will also have to input and verify their location using location tracking services. With all this information, the algorithm will match users with others. 

Scope

The scope of this project is not too difficult. It is a compilation of many implementation concepts that many of us students are already familiar with. Therefore, I predict that it will take a small team of 3-5 developers.
